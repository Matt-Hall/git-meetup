# git-meetup
Public repository for the Wausau.js meetup on 1-14-20

We will use this repository to plan a trip as a group. A trip to where, you ask? Well, the theme is Star Wars! Didn't like how Alderaan was obliterated by the Death Star? Use this as your opportunity to briefly re-write Star Wars history and visit the peaceful planet! We will utilize various Stars Wars wiki-pages and we will not worry about being historically correct with it since it can all get a bit complicated and not all of us are Star Wars fans.
